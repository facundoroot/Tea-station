# E-COMMERCE

This is an e-commerce website, there are two types of accounts: user and admin. When you create your account, it will be automatically an user account, if you wanna access admin functionalities you'll have to change your type of account in the database.
As an admin, you can create products and categories, and make all kind of modifications to them, add the numbers of products you have so the clients knows how many items to buy.
The costumer will have a purchase order and cart where all the selected items will be in display, you can also change the state of the order so the costumer knows if his order is purchased,already sent,etc.
The products will be shown randomly in the home site and every one of them can be opened to see more information.
In the sidebar, the name, last name, number of items and total amount of money to pay of the logged user will be shown, if there is no user logged, the link to registration will be displayed.
In config/parameters the constant base_url has the url of the local host so you have to change it to yours.
